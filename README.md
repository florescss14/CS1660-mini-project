You first have to build the images as seen in the corresponding readme files in sa-frontend, sa-web-app, and sa-logic. Then you can use the following commands on the GCP console to get the images onto the container registry:
docker pull florescss14/DockerImageName

Tag your Image with Google proper way:
docker tag florescss14/DockerImageName  gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/florescss14/DockerImageName:version

Push your Image to the Google Container Registry
docker push gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/florescss14/DockerImageName:version
